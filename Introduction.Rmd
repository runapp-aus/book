This book was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The complete source is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/runapp-aus/book). 
This version of the book was built with `r R.version.string` and the following packages.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
deps <- renv::dependencies(quiet = TRUE, dev = TRUE)
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(deps$Package, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df)
```
